# Define a new function fungus_among_us() which accepts a list `plants` as an argument
#   return True if the function contains the string "fungus" and False if not
# 	don't overthink this one, there's a very simple method to doing it...
#   Example: fungus_among_us( ["tree", "flower", "fungus", "moss"] ) >>> True

# Define a new function total_bill() which accepts a list of numbers `item_costs`
#   return the sum total of all items in the list
#   Example: total_bill( [6, 9.99, 20] ) >>> 35.99

# Define a new function halfway_there() which accepts a list of arbitrary data `items` longer than 1 item
#   insert the string "HALFWAY" at the middle of the list and return the altered list
#   Example: halfway_there( [1,2,3,4,5,6] ) >>> [1,2,3,"HALFWAY",4,5,6]
